# The status quo

dbscripts never had an explicit license. It was an internal project, so perhaps
we thought it was obvious! And we're all working together, so everything should
be fine, right??? Well, that's still not great, instead it is confusion.

# A solution

On 2019-12-12 I (Eli Schwartz) emailed the primary contributors to dbscripts,
and we agreed to explicitly license all our past contributions as
GPL-2.0-or-later. This covers the following contributions:

-  246	Pierre Schmitz
-  207	Aaron Griffin
-   65	Judd Vinet
-   32	Eli Schwartz
-   29	Dan McGee

# Outstanding issues

We still need to contact these people and acquire a license grant or otherwise
resolve the status of their contributions.
